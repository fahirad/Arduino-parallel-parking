# Arduino-parallel-parking
## The first version. 

The setup is almost the same as in the previous project (line follower),  with an eception of additional two sensors, this time ultrasonic sensors 
that are used to measure the distance between the sensor and the closest object to it. 

This is the first version of the project that my team and I wrote. 
It can be much improved to rely upon the sensors more, 
but this was enough to learn about the usage and implement the logic wanted.
